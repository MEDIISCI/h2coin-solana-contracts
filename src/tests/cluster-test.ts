/**
 * @fileoverview Cluster Connection Test Suite for H2Coin Vault Share Program
 * This test suite validates the cluster connection functionality including provider setup,
 * wallet connection, and basic cluster interaction for the H2Coin program.
 * 
 * SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Tests cluster connection and provider initialization
 * - Validates wallet connection and balance retrieval
 * - Ensures proper network connectivity for program operations
 * - Tests basic cluster interaction functionality
 * 
 * @audit This test suite is critical for infrastructure validation and should be reviewed for:
 * - Cluster connection security and reliability
 * - Provider initialization and configuration
 * - Wallet connection validation
 * - Network connectivity verification

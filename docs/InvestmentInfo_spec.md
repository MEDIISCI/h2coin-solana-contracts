## 📦 Account: `InvestmentInfo`

The InvestmentInfo account is used to define, control, and govern a specific investment project. It encapsulates all necessary configuration and security logic, such as distribution ratios, governance whitelists, lifecycle status, and the vault linkage. It is uniquely identified by a PDA derived from the investment ID and version.

This account:

*   Serves as the canonical source of truth for an investment project
*   Is referenced by other PDAs like vaults, investment records, and profit/refund caches
*   Drives the state machine of the investment through instructions like complete, deactivate, etc.
*   Enforces 3-of-5 multisig authorization for critical updates

---

## 🧭 Interpretation

The InvestmentInfo account represents a unique investment project configuration and status. It defines all the essential parameters and governance rules required to manage the investment lifecycle on-chain.

This account:

*   Acts as the central reference for any vault, record, or distribution operations
*   Stores key metadata like timeframes, whitelist governance, and distribution ratios
*   Is a PDA derived from `investment_id` and version, making it unique and secure
*   Controls the state transition of an investment: Init → Pending → Completed → Deactivated
*   Is validated before any on-chain instructions (e.g., add record, refund, profit share)

### 🧮 PDA Derivation

```
seeds = [
            b"profit_cache", 
            investment_info.investment_id.as_ref(),
            investment_info.version.as_ref(),
        ],
        
PDA = find_program_address(seeds, program_id)
```

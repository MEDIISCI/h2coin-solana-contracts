# üìú State Specification: H2Coin Vault Share Protocol

This document describes the on-chain state accounts and data structures used in the H2Coin Vault Share Protocol. All account layouts are defined using the Anchor framework on Solana and are tightly packed for predictable space usage.

## üß© State Struct Overview

This section summarizes all on-chain state accounts and their purpose in the H2Coin Vault Share Protocol:

| State Account | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `InvestmentInfo` | Core configuration for an investment campaign, including whitelists, stage ratios, limits, and vault reference. |
| `InvestmentRecord` | Stores each individual investor‚Äôs record for a specific investment, including USDT and H2COIN amounts. |
| `ProfitShareCache` | Caches the precomputed profit-sharing entries for one batch, preventing duplicate computation or execution. |
| `RefundShareCache` | Caches the estimated H2COIN refund entries for one batch-year based on the stage and year index. |

#### **Methods**

*   `validate_stage_ratio()`

Ensures each investment stage contains contiguous non-zero entries and that the total sum of all stage ratios is less than or equal to 1000 (i.e., 100%).

```
pub fn validate_stage_ratio(&self) -> bool
```

*   `verify_signers_3_of_5(signer_keys: &[Pubkey], is_update: bool)`

Checks whether at least 3 out of 5 valid whitelist signers have signed the transaction. Selects the correct whitelist based on the `is_update` flag.

```
pub fn verify_signers_3_of_5(&self, signer_keys: &[Pubkey], is_update: bool) 
```

*   `enforce_3_of_5_signers<'info>(signer_infos: &[AccountInfo<'info>], is_update: bool) -> Result<()>`

Extracts signer public keys from `AccountInfo` and invokes `verify_signers_3_of_5`. Returns an error if signature requirement is not met.

```
pub fn enforce_3_of_5_signers<'info>(
    &self,
    signer_infos: &[AccountInfo<'info>],
    is_update: bool
) -> Result<()>

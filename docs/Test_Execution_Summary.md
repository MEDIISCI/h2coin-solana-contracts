### Environment Requirements

#### Required Environment Variables
```bash
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=your_solana_cluster_url
ANCHOR_WALLET=path_to_wallet_keypair.json
USDT_MINT=your_usdt_mint_address
H2coin_MINT=your_h2coin_mint_address
```

#### Dependencies
```bash
npm install @coral-xyz/anchor @solana/web3.js @solana/spl-token
npm install mocha chai
```

### Test Validation Checklist

#### Pre-execution Checks
- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Dependencies installed completely
- [ ] Network connection normal
- [ ] Test keypairs ready

#### Execution Monitoring
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Error handling correct
- [ ] State changes as expected
- [ ] Security mechanisms effective

#### Post-execution Validation
- [ ] Program state consistent
- [ ] Data integrity maintained
- [ ] Security controls effective
- [ ] Audit logs complete

### Common Issues

#### 1. Environment Variable Errors
**Issue**: `Missing ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL or ANCHOR_WALLET`
**Solution**: Check `.env` file configuration

#### 2. Network Connection Failures
**Issue**: Unable to connect to Solana cluster
**Solution**: Check network connection and cluster URL

#### 3. Keypair Errors
**Issue**: Keypair file doesn't exist or format error
**Solution**: Regenerate or check keypair file

#### 4. Insufficient Compute Units
**Issue**: Transaction fails due to insufficient compute units
**Solution**: Increase units in `modifyComputeUnits`

# üìò H2Coin Vault Share Protocol ‚Äì README

## ü§© Overview

The **H2Coin Vault Share Protocol** is a secure and scalable Solana-based smart contract system designed to manage decentralized investment, profit sharing, and refund distribution.

It ensures asset safety through multi-signature authorization, batch processing via Address Lookup Tables (ALT), and strict constraint validation. The protocol is ideal for managing DAO treasuries, investor payouts, and time-based reward mechanisms.

## üåü Project Objectives

*   ‚úÖ Enable decentralized profit and refund distribution
*   ‚úÖ Support investor batch management with ALT
*   ‚úÖ Enforce 3-of-5 multisig on all critical actions
*   ‚úÖ Provide replay protection via cache locking
*   ‚úÖ Ensure upgrade-safety and deterministic state control

## ‚öôÔ∏è Protocol Architecture

### Core Components:

*   `InvestmentInfo`: Metadata for each investment campaign
*   `InvestmentRecord`: Tracks investor participation per stage/batch
*   `ProfitShareCache`: Stores estimated profit per batch (one-time)
*   `RefundShareCache`: Caches refund amounts based on yearly stages
*   `Vault PDA`: Holds SOL, USDT, and H2COIN for secure distribution

### Entry Points (Instructions):

| Instruction | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `initialize` | Initialize investment config and whitelist |
| `update_investment_info` | Update metadata and version control |
| `add_investment_record` | Add a new investor record |
| `estimate_profit_share` | Estimate per-investor profit and cache result |
| `execute_profit_share` | Perform USDT transfer to investors using cache |
| `estimate_refund_share` | Estimate yearly refunds per stage |
| `execute_refund_share` | Send H2COIN refunds using stage-based logic |
| `withdraw_from_vault` | Withdraw tokens/SOL to approved recipients |

> üîê All critical instructions require 3-of-5 whitelist signer validation.

## üöÄ Deployment & Testing

### 1\. **Authority Keypair**
```
solana address --keypair ./assets/deploy/devnet-keypair.json 

9HJ4pswgZDcWYkqCxxXhmE4KLRP1i4ZXhcGYgq5sDBDG
```
### 2\. **Program id Keypiar**
```
solana address --keypair ./target/deploy/h2coin_vault_share-keypair.json 

ALjifiKwvSzKLfpebFZ185b3mLAxroEvxYXCcy9Lzw2B
```
### 3\. **Set Up Devent Environment**

```
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
solana config set --keypair ./assets/deploy/devnet-keypair.json
solana config get

Config File: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com 
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ./assets/deploy/devnet-keypair.json 
Commitment: confirmed 
```

### 4\. **Build & Deploy**

```
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

### 5\. **Run Tests**

```
anchor test
```

Tests are written using Mocha + Chai and simulate multi-batch execution with real token transfers and whitelist signer emulation.
